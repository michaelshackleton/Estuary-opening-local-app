"""
Fetches Landsat/Sentinel-2 scenes from Digital Earth Australia's STAC
catalogue for an on-the-fly, user-drawn region of interest, and runs the
open/closed connectivity analysis (see connectivity.py) on each scene.

Reuses the STACDataManager / RSDataProductManager classes originally from
this repo's src/rs_data.py and src/rs_processing.py, vendored verbatim into
Claude_script/vendor/ (along with their own dependencies - utils.py and
rsderiv/sharpen.py, rsderiv/sen1.py) so that this Claude_script folder is
fully self-contained and can be copied/moved anywhere without needing the
rest of the rs-utils-main repository alongside it. See vendor/README.md for
what was copied and why. The one thing this module deliberately avoids is
STACDataManager.stac_ds_to_product()'s `.rio.to_raster()` write path, which
throws "Only 2D and 3D data arrays supported" on this project's multiband
datasets - scenes are instead written to GeoTIFF here directly
(write_scene_geotiff), band-by-band, which sidesteps whatever is tripping
up that path.

STACRSRegionManager (in rs_data.py) only knows how to load a region's
polygon from a shapefile/geopackage path via a region parameter JSON file.
Since this app defines regions on the fly by drawing on a map, rather than
editing that class, InMemoryRegionManager below duck-types the same
interface (get_polygon / get_region_extent) directly from a GeoDataFrame.

    connectivity analysis on each, and returns a list of per-scene result
    rows (dicts) - one per record.date/sensor - ready for
    aggregate.build_results_df().

    `min_roi_coverage` (0-1) drops any scene whose tile doesn't cover at
    least that fraction of the drawn ROI polygon - e.g. dates where the ROI
    straddles two tiles collected on different days, or sits right at the
    edge of a swath. Defaults to requiring (near-)full coverage, since a
    partially-covering tile leaves part of the ROI as nodata, which usually
    just produces an indeterminate result rather than a useful one - so
    filtering these out up front both avoids that noise and cuts down the
    number of scenes that need fetching/analysing. Pass 0 to disable this
    filter and keep every scene regardless of coverage.

    The connectivity analysis itself only ever needs each scene in memory
    momentarily - it never reads back from a cached file - so caching
    rasters to disk here is purely an optional convenience, not something
    the analysis depends on. `cache_rasters=False` (the default) skips
    writing any GeoTIFFs at all during this run, which is what keeps
    `data_cache/` from filling up with every scene in a multi-decade run
    when most of them will never be looked at again. Set `cache_rasters=
    True` if you specifically want every scene from this run cached ahead
    of time for fast preview clicking afterwards (uses much more disk).
    Regardless of this setting, `fetch_single_scene()` can fetch any one
    scene on demand later - which is what the app's scene preview uses by
    default instead of relying on a pre-populated cache.

    `cache_dir` is only actually used as a location to write to when
    `cache_rasters=True` (or via `fetch_single_scene()` below) - if omitted,
    a temporary directory is used instead (STACDataManager requires some
    root directory to exist, but writes nothing into it unless asked to).

    `cloud_buffer_px` is passed straight through to
    connectivity.process_scene() for every scene - see that function's
    docstring (int, {"sentinel2": n, "landsat": n} dict, or None for
    connectivity.DEFAULT_CLOUD_BUFFER_PX).

    `enable_temporal_anomaly` builds a per-pixel clear-sky reference (see
    connectivity.build_clear_sky_reference) from this run's own scene time
    series for each product, and applies connectivity's temporal-anomaly
    check to every scene using it - complementary to the cloud-edge buffer,
    since it can catch thin/dappled cloud fmask's own algorithm never
    flagged as cloud at all (which the buffer, only ever dilating outward
    from cells fmask DID flag, cannot). Off by default since it needs
    `nbart_blue` in the product's bands and adds a bit of per-run compute;
    when `cache_dir` is given, the built reference is also cached to disk
    (see save_temporal_reference_cache/load_cached_temporal_reference) so
    fetch_single_scene()'s preview path can reuse it later. `_percentile`/
    `_min_obs` control how the reference itself is built - see
    connectivity.build_clear_sky_reference's docstring.
